<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You get the 'Unexpected end-of-file detected' error from passenger, after making some changes of the deployment location.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Check that the application's log file is created, as if it not automatically created and not there passenger complains with the previous error.</p>
