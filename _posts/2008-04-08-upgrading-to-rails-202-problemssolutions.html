<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
Upgrading from Rails version 1.2.3 to version 2.0.2.<br />
Following the suggestion in DH's weblog <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done">here</a> when using sudo gem install rails -y, it gets the trunk version of rails which at the time was 2.0.2.9216.<br />
This causes a few problems and breaks a few more things.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
In order to get back to the latest stable version, you have to uninstall a few of the gems installed from the trunk version.<br />
If you have installed the latest version of top of an existing one using gems, then doing:</p>
<pre class="code">gem list --local</pre>
<p>will give you all the installed versions of the gems. Something like:</p>
<pre class="code">actionmailer (2.0.2.9216, 2.0.2, 1.3.3)
actionpack(2.0.2.9216, 2.0.2, 1.3.3)
rails(2.0.2.9216, 2.0.2, 1.2.3)
...</pre>
<p>Make sure you uninstall all the gems with version number 2.0.2.9216:</p>
<pre class="code">sudo gem uninstall rails
sudo gem uninstall actionmailer
sudo gem uninstall actionpack
sudo gem uninstall activerecord
sudo gem uninstall activeresource
sudo gem uninstall activesupport
sudo gem uninstall rails</pre>
<p>In each of the above commands the gem package manager should ask you to select the one you want to uninstall.<br />
Pick the one with the 2.0.2.9216 (or other version later than 2.0.2).</p>
<p>At the end if you list the gems again you should only have gems going up to version 2.0.2</p>
<p>An extra step I had to take for making the migrations work was to install rake again:</p>
<pre class="code">sudo gem install rake</pre>
<p>After all these my installation seems to be working fine again.</p>
