<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You have set up your capistrano recipe for deployment to dreamhost using password less logins, but after dreamhost moves your git repository server to a different server, the deployment breaks, with 'permission denied' when trying to get the git repository.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
As the server was moved you would need to copy your ssh public key from the deployment server to the new server again for the password-less logins to work again.<br />
Follow the details <a href="http://www.42.mach7x.com/2008/02/06/password-less-logins-and-aliases-with-ssh/">here</a> how to copy your public key across, login in once with your password, and after that your capistrano recipe should be working again as normal.</p>
