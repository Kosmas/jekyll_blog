<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to export some query results from MySQL into a format that can be imported in LibreOffice, OpenOffice or Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Try first with the default export options, as by doing a google search, there are a lot of different options for specifying field delimeters, lines terminated, etc.<br />
So by not specifying any additional options the export is a tab delimited, linefeed-terminated file which should work in most of the programs.<br />
So in order to do that you would need a folder in the MySQL server that should have write access. Usually /tmp should do. Then you can build your query and at the end add the INTO OUTFILE '/path', like:</p>
<pre class="shell">SELECT one,max(two) max_two,min(three) min_three 
FROM table 
WHERE one=1 
GROUP BY one 
INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/my_query.csv';</pre>
<p>You can use any file ending but usually by specifying .csv the program that you will try to open will understand it.</p>
