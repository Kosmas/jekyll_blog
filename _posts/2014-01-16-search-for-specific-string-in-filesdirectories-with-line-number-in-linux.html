<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You want to search in a directory or some files for a specific string and you also want to know the number in the file that the text is found.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Use grep with the -n for the line number and the -r for directory search as in the following:</p>
<pre class="shell">grep -n -r 'search_item' /path/to/folder/</pre>
