<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
After dreamhost decided to move my account that hosted the git repository to a new server, first time I've tried to push some changes to the git repository I was faced with the followng error:</p>
<p><code>Counting objects: 13, done.<br />
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.<br />
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.<br />
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 699 bytes, done.<br />

To ssh://dh_user@dh_domain/home/repository_path/projects/project.git</code></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
After searching and finding out various solutions to solve the problem, none of which was specific to a server move, I've tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Followed the steps <a href="http://www.42.mach7x.com/2010/03/12/getting-your-github-git-project-to-dreamhost/">here</a> to set up a new repository project_asm.git</li>
<li>went to local project changed the config file to add the new remote repository</li>
<li>issued <code>git push new_remote master</code></li>
<li>make a code change and then <code>git push</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And everything should work as normal again.</p>
