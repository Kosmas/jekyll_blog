<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to disable your rails web site for maintenance, but your application uses an older capistrano version than the one currently installed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
According to the RubyOnRails Cookbook recipe 13.12, it should only be a case of running cap disable_web (enable_web).<br />
But in the meantime you have upgraded your capistrano version to version 2, and started using mongrel server as well.<br />
So if you are using virtual severs and proxy with mongrel, the first thing to do is add the following in your Apache configuration file:</p>
<pre class="code">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/system/maintenance.html -f
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !maintenance.html
RewriteRule ^.*$ /system/maintenance.html [R]</pre>
<p>If you needed to make the above change then you will have to restart apache in your server.</p>
<p>Then in your local pc you can run the following:</p>
<pre class="code">export REASON="Maintenance for MySQL upgrade"
export UNTIL="Sat May 10 15:30:00 2008"
cap _1.4.1_ disable_web (to put it in maintenance)
cap _1.4.1_ enable_web (to restart it again)</pre>
