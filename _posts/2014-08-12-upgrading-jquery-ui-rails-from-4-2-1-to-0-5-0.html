<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to upgrade your jquery-ui-rails gem from a version before 0.5.x to the latest version 0.5.0, but when you do that your tests are failing with error messages similar to the one below:</p>
<pre class="shell">ActionView::Template::Error: 
couldn't find file 'jquery.ui.effect-blind'</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>According to the changelog the naming between 4.2.1 and 0.5.0 has changed <a href="https://github.com/joliss/jquery-ui-rails">jquery-ui-rails</a></p>
<p>So if you were using something like the following in your app/assets/javascripts/applications.js file (as used in the depot example in the Agile Web Development with Rails 4 book):</p>
<pre class="shell">//= require jquery.ui.effect-blind</pre>
<p>you would need to change it to the following after upgrading your jquery-ui-rails gem to ~> 0.5.0:</p>
<pre class="shell">//= require jquery-ui/effect-blind</pre>
