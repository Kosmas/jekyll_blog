<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You are using a polymorphic association in your application, and you would like to know how exactly the as declaration in your model has_many is used in the SQL by ActiveRecord. So following the example in the Rails Guides with the following models:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">class Picture &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :imageable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
end

class Employee &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :pictures, :as =&gt; :imageable
end

class Product &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :pictures, :as =&gt; :imageable
end</pre>
<p><strong>Solution </strong></p>
<p>ActiveRecord uses the as in the model declaration as a guide to find the foreign id key in the polymorphic association, by adding the _id to the :as name. So following the<br />
example above the query for the product would be:</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">SELECT `images`.*
FROM `images`
WHERE (`ratings`.imageable_id = 289
      AND `images`.imageable_type = 'Product')</pre>
