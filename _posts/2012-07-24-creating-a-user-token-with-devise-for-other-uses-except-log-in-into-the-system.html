<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You are using Devise in your rails application, and you want to have a token for authenticating an API call, but you don't want to use the default authentication token so that.<br />
The purpose of doing something like that is that you don't want the application to have the same authentication rights as the devise authentication tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Add the field to your user model (ie app_token).</p>
<p>On your user model create the following:</p>
<pre class="shell">class User < ActiveRecord::Base

before_create :create_app_token
...
private
def create_app_token
  self.app_token = Devise.friendly_token
end</pre>
