<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>After a new rvm installation in an (k)ubuntu system you get the following error from rvm when trying to switch between rubies:</p>
<pre class="shell">You need to change your terminal emulator preferences to allow login shell.
Sometimes it is required to use `/bin/bash --login` as the command.
Please visit https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/ for a example.</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>As the message suggests you can change the setting in your terminal which is fine if you are using the gnome-terminal by going to the link provided:</p>
<pre class="shell">Please visit <a href="https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/">https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/</a> for a example.</pre>
<p>but if you are using Konsole in KDE you need to go to a different link that explains the change in the settings:</p>
<pre class="shell">Please visit <a href="http://rvm.io/integration/konsole/">http://rvm.io/integration/konsole/</a> for a example.</pre>
