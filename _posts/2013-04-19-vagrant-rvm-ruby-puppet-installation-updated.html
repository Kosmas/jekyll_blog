<p>It seesm that the latest images of vagrant come preinstalled with rvm so the updated installation instructions from <a href="http://www.42.mach7x.com/2012/12/11/vagrant-rvm-ruby-puppet-installation-instructions/">here</a> are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install vagrant from <a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/">here</a> as a package and NOT as a rubygem, as it has been removed from the latest versions</li>
<li>
</li>
</ol>
