<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to use ActiveScaffold in your application, that you have developed using Rails 2.1, and you want to deploy it in Dreamhost, which at the moment has Rails 2.0.2.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Don't use the installation instructions in the main page from ActiveScaffold's website that uses the version in git:</p>
<pre class="code">git clone git://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold.git vendor/plugins/active_scaffold && rm -rf vendor/plugins/active_scaffold/.git</pre>
<p>but use the older version that it's in svn and the installation instructions are:</p>
<pre class="code">./script/plugin install http://activescaffold.googlecode.com/svn/tags/active_scaffold</pre>
<p>bu</p>
