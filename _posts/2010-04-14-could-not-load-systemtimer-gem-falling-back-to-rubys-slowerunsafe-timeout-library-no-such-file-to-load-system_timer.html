<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You have the error showing up after starting either the server (./script/server) or the console (./script/console).<br />
For my particular case it started appearing after installing the Rails 3.0 beta3 version, and in an application developed with Rails 2.3.2.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Just install the system_timer gem:<br />
<span class="code">sudo gem install system_timer</span></p>
