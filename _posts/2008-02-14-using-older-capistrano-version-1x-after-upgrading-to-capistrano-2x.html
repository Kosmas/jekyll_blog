<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You have just upgraded your Capistrano installation to version 2.x, but you didn't have time to convert your recipes to the newer version.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
In order to be able to use your old recipes of Capistrano version 1.x after upgrading, you can use the following (assuming your version 1.x is 1.4.1):</p>
<pre class="code">cap _1.4.1_ deploy</pre>
<p>or, if you have migrations you want to use:</p>
<pre class="code">cap _1.4.1_ deploy_with_migrations</pre>
