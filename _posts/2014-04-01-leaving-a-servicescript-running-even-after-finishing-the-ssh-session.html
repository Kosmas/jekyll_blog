<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to run a service/script on a server that you have logged in with ssh, but you want to leave it running even after you have terminated the ssh session.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Use the nohup command so do the following in your ssh session:</p>
<pre>nohup /service/i_want_to_run &</pre>
