<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You want to be able to go through a scenario step by step when you are testing with a browser as sometimes can be very fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>By following the suggestion <a href="http://itshouldbeuseful.wordpress.com/tag/cucumber/">here</a> you would only need to add the following to your features/support/hooks.rb file</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">AfterStep('@pause') do
  print "Press Return to continue ..."
  STDIN.getc
end</pre>
<p>and then you should be able to use it in your scenario by adding the @pause tag.<br />
Then you would have to press continue in your terminal to go step by step</p>
