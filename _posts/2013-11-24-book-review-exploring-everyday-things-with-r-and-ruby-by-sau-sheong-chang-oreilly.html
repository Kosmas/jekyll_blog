<p>Exploring Everyday Things with R and Ruby, as the title suggests, is a book about data exploration, written in a very easy and very unusual way, that will make it hard to put down.</p>
<p>In the beginining it starts with a short introduction to the two languages used to achieve its purpose.</p>
<p>It gives a short explanation about the reason of using Ruby, followed by installation instructions and some basic ruby information. After that there is a short introduction to Ruby's UI toolkit called Shoes.</p>
<p>The second initial part covers the other language to be used in the examples to follow, R. There are again the reason for picking R, installation instructions and a brief introduction to the capabilities of the language and especially the data analysis and graphing abilities.</p>
<p>Following the first two parts, is where the book starts to get really interesting and fun and it will certainly make you want to try the examples worked on.<br />
Subjects like 'Offices and Restrooms' which is about deternining the correct people-to-restrooms ratio, 'How to Be an Armchair Economist' about a market economy simulation, 'Discover Yourself Through Email' dealing with email data mining, 'In A Heartbeat' for measuring the hearbeat, including a homemade digital stethoscope, 'Schooling Fish and Flocking Birds' a simulation of the Boids algorithm in Ruby, and finally 'Money, Sex and Evolution' an entire artificial world populate by the roids of the previous example.</p>
<p>All of the examples are fascinating, something that I would never imagine it would be possible to simulate before reading this book, and also include information about their specific fields.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, it is a very enjoyable, interesting and out of the ordinary book, helped greatly by the author's unique writing style, and one that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in Ruby or R to read.</p>
