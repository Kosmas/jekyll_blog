<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You would like to know your MySQL's server timezone, especially if you have more than one and you want to compare them if they have the same or not.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Just run the following SQL:</p>
<pre class="shell">SELECT @@system_time_zone</pre>
