<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You are using the script/dbconsole utility in Rails (with sqlite), and you want to exit the application but the usual keystrokes/commands like quit, exit, Ctrl + C don't work.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
You have to use the following keyword, paying particular notice in the leading dot (.exit):</p>
<pre class="code">.exit</pre>
