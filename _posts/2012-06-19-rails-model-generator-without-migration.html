<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to run the rails model generator to create a new model, but you don't want the migration for that model as it could be included in another migration (ie grouped together with other tables).</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Just run the generator with the --migration=false option as in:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">rails g model ModelName --migration=false</pre>
