<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
To get used to the new ways of working with Rails 2.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Here are some of the new ways of doing things in Rails 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a scaffold and migration on one step:
<pre class="code">./script/generate scaffold product fied1_name:string field2_name:string field3_name:float</pre>
<p>  Make sure that you don't have any previous migration(ie manually created) for the same model, as the generator will stop and won't overwrite the previous migration.
  </li>
</ol>
