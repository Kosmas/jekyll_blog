<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You have forgotten your web-gui credentials to login into your dd-wrt router but you have still telnet access to it.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Login with telnet to your router and then run the following two commands to reset the web interface:</p>
<pre class="shell">nvram set http_passwd=
nvram commit</pre>
<p>and then go to your Web interface to set a new one.</p>
<p>* Based on <a href="http://www.righteoushack.net/reset-dd-wrt-http-password-using-ssh/" title="ssh reset of dd-wrt web ui" target="_blank">this post</a></p>
