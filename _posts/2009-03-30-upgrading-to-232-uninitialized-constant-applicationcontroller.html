<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
Upgrading from a previous version of Rails to the latest 2.3.2, you get an error:</p>
<pre class="code">NameError: uninitialized constant ApplicationController</pre>
<p>both in the web browser and in console.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Since the introduction of Rails 2.3 the application.rb file has been renamed to application_controller.rb.<br />
So in order to solve the problem just rename your file application.rb to application_controller.rb.</p>
<p>Thanks to the post <a href="http://www.hackido.com/2009/03/quick-tip-solve-uninitialized-constant.html">here</a></p>
