<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
When you try to create a new Rails 3.0.x application, and try to use the 'mysql2' gem in your Gemfile without specifying a version you get the following warnings:</p>
<p><code>WARNING: This version of mysql2 (0.3.2) doesn't ship with the ActiveRecord adapter bundled anymore as it's now part of Rails 3.1<br />
WARNING: Please use the 0.2.x releases if you plan on using it in Rails <= 3.0.x</code></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Specify the latest version of mysql2 that is compatible with the Rails 3.0.x versions as in:</p>
<p><code>gem 'mysql2', "~> 0.2.7"</code></p>
