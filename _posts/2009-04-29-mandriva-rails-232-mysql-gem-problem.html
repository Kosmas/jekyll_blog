<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You are trying to install the mysql gem in Mandriva, but it fails with error messages:</p>
<pre class="code">ERROR:  Error installing mysql:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension...
checking for mysql_query() in -lmysclient... no ....</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
After searching in google, with solutions about providing different options (-- --with-mysql-config, ..etc), even trying different combinations for providing the client library path, the configuration file, or the header file path, was still faced with the same error installing the mysql gem.<br />
As the Mandriva installation was quite new, it turns out to be a couple of missing packages.<br />
So try:</p>
<pre class="code">urpmi gcc
urpmi make</pre>
<p>and run:</p>
<pre class="code">gem install mysql</pre>
<p>again.</p>
<p>It should work out ok install the gem and output:</p>
<pre class="code">Building native extensions. This could take a while...
Successfully installed mysql-2.7
1 gem installed</pre>
