<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You have left a message in a squirrel mail account in dreamhost for a long time and it gets archived by dreamhost. According to the dreamhost you should be able to get to your archived messages, by looking at the old-messages folder.<br />
The problem is that just by logging in to squirrel mail the folder doesn't get displayed on the left hand side.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Log on to squirrel mail and go to 'Folders' menu at the top.<br />
In the 'Create Folder' put 'test' or anything that you would like in the text box, and make sure that in the dropdown box you select 'INBOX.old-messages', so your newly created folder is a subfolder of the 'inbox/old-messages' folder.<br />
Create the subfolder, refresh the page, and in your left hand the old-messages folder should appear.</p>
