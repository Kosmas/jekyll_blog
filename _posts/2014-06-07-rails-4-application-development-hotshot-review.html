<p>A new book about rails 4 development has recently been published by Packt called <a href="http://bit.ly/1m6Moxf">Rails 4 application development HOTSHOT</a>.</p>
<p>It is a book that can be described as a ruby on rails application cookbook. It focuses on the changes with the rails version 4 and includes a lot of the latest techniques and practices developing rails applications.</p>
<p>The book consists of 10 different projects, that can be used as the basis for further developing these applications.<br />
The projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Recipe-sharing Website</li>
<li>Conference and Event RSVP Management</li>
<li>Online Social Pinboard</li>
<li>Restaurant Menu Builder</li>
<li>Customisable CMS</li>
<li>Analytics Dashboard</li>
<li>Api Mashup - Twitter and Google maps</li>
<li>API only application</li>
<li>Video streaming website</li>
<li>Rails engines E-commerce</li>
</ul>
<p>In each one of them different aspects of development are presented, for example twitter-bootstrap integration, devise authentication and so on.</p>
<p>So concluding this short review, this is a book that is recommended for ruby on rails developers with some previous experience, and it can provide the starting point for quite a few interesting projects.</p>
