<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>When you interrupt a cucumber test, usualy by presssing Ctrl+C twice, the database tables are not truncated, so you consequently could have a problem with duplicates records.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>To make sure that the database is clear before running the test again run the following tasks to clear the database and clone it again:</p>
<pre class="shell">rake db:test:purge
rake db:test:clone</pre>
