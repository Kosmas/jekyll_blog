<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to use cvs to checkout a repository from a remote server.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
If you were using subversion it would be very simple to do by using the remote url.<br />
In CVS you have to to do the following:<br />
First find out where the cvsroot in the remote server is. We will assume for this example that is located in /usr/local/cvsroot.<br />
Then run the following on your local linux pc:</p>
<pre class="code">export CVSROOT=:ext:user_name@remote_pc:/path_to_csvroot export
export CVS_RSH=ssh</pre>
<p>You then should be able to do a checkout by typing the following and supplying your password:</p>
<pre class="code">cvs checkout project_name</pre>
