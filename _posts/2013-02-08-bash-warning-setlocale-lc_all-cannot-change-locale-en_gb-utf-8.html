<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>When trying to connect with ssh to a linux (debian- ubuntu) server you get the following error:</p>
<pre class="shell">bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_GB.UTF-8)</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The reason is that the server is missing the en_US locale that your client is trying to use to connect to the server.<br />
Login to the server and by using sudo (or su) run the following to install the missing en_US locale and make sure that you leave default to 'None' as described <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Locale" title="locale" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<pre class="shell">dpkg-reconfigure locales</pre>
