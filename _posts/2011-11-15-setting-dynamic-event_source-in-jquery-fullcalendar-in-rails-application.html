<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to use the fullcalendar jquery plugin to be able to display events in your rails application, but you also want to be able to set the eventSources dynamically depending on the path to your view, especially if your view contains a relationship as in the following example:</p>
<p>model_a/1/model_b (user/14/comments)</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Change your eventSources to be something like the following and using the jQuery.ajaxSettings.url :</p>
<pre class="brush:js"> // a future calendar might have many sources.
    eventSources: [{
      url: jQuery.ajaxSettings.url,
      color: 'orange',
      textColor: 'black',
      ignoreTimezone: false
    }],</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
