<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to link the commits to a github repository to your github account but you may have different git accounts (ie gitolite etc).<br />
So you would need to specify in the config file which account you want to use.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>There is a help page in github that describes this problem <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user">here</a>, but they recommend to change your global settings which is maybe not what you want.<br />
So you could the following to change only the current project settings:</p>
<pre class="shell">cd ~/my_project
git config --local user.email="your_github_account_email"</pre>
<p>And to check the settings:</p>
<pre class="shell">git config --local -l
git config --global -l</pre>
