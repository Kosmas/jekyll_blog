<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You are developing on the latest version of Rails (2.1), but your production server for deployment uses version 2.0.2 (as dreamhost is using at the moment). </p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First change the environment.rb file to use the rails version in your deployment server
<pre class="code">RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.0.2' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION
</pre>
</li>
<li>You should probably be geting the error: <i>undefined method = time zone </i> by now, so make sure you comment out from further down your environment.rb file the line:
<pre class="code">config.time_zone = 'UTC'</pre>
</li>
<li>Some further errors would be caused by the file config/initializers/new_rails_defaults.rb, so make sure you comment out the following lines:
<pre class="code">ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = true
ActiveRecord::Base.store_full_sti_class = true
ActiveSupport.use_standard_json_time_format = true
ActiveSupport.use_standard_json_time_format = true</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should be able to deploy and use your application now.</p>
