<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to send emails from a Ruby on Rails application, when there is a specific condition on a database table. If the database table gets modified by another application outside Rails you cannot use an observer model.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
We already assume that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are using a database</li>
<li>You have a model named voicemail (id, number_id, audio, created_at, updated_at)</li>
<li>You have a model named number (id, voicemail_email_set, voicemail_email, ....)</li>
<li>A mail server to use (smtp in our case)</li>
<li>Another application (voice application) populates the voicemail table but with empty updated_at values</li>
</ul>
<p>So the steps we have to follow are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the settings in your config/environment.rb file to use the settings for your mail server, and make sure you restart your application after the changes:
<pre class="code">ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :address        => "yourmailserver.com",
  :port           =>  25,
  :domain         => "your.domain.com",
  :authentication => :login,
  :user_name      => "your_smtp_username",
  :password       => "your_smtp_password",
  :raise_delivery_errors  => true}</pre>
</li>
<li>Create your mailer model (ie voicemail_mailer.rb), in app/models:
<pre class="code">class VoicemailMailer < ActionMailer::Base
   # We need the open-uri to be able to open url *** if the file to attach is in an http location ***
  require 'open-uri'
 
  def sent(email_to,email_from,email_subject,email_body,voicemail_to_send)
    # Check to see if we have a file for the email body message
    @subject    = email_subject
    @body       = email_body
    @recipients = email_to
    @from       = email_from
    @sent_on    = Time.now
    
    # Split the file in directory and filename
    file_path = File.split(voicemail_to_send)
    file_dir  = file_path[0]
    file_name = file_path[1]
    
    # Get the file
    tmp_file = open(voicemail_to_send).read
    
    part( :content_type => "application/wav", 
          :disposition => "attachment; filename=#{file_name}", 
          :transfer_encoding => "base64") do |attachment|
            attachment.body = tmp_file
    end
  end
end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Create your email scheduler in file lib/email_scheduler.rb:
<pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/env /path_to_your_app/script/runner

# get all the voicemails that have not been sent yet 
voicemails_to_email = VoiceMail.find(:all, :conditions => 'updated_at is null')

# For all the voicemails we have, send them and update the field date_sent
for vm2email in voicemails_to_email do
  # Get the number for the voicemail
  number = Number.find(vm2email.number_id)
  
  # check to see if the send to email is set for the number
  if number.voicemail_email_set
    # Get number details (email_to,email_from etc)
    email_to          = number.voicemail_email
    voicemail_to_send = vm2email.audio
    # Set other details
    email_from      = 'Service@yourdomain.com'
    email_subject   = 'Please find attached your voicemail message'
    email_body      = "Received on: #{Time.now} \n for number: #{number.phone_no}"

    # Now send the email
    VoicemailMailer.deliver_sent(email_to,email_from,email_subject,email_body,voicemail_to_send)

    # And update the record's date_sent field
    vm2email.updated_at = Time.now
    vm2email.save
  end
end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Create a task in your crontab that runs the scheduler (every five minutes):
<pre class="code">0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * path_to_your_ror_app/lib/email_scheduler.rb</pre>
</li>
</ol>
