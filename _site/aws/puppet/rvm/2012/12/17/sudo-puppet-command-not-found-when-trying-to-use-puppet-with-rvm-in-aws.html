<p>When trying to use the
<pre class="code">rvmsudo puppet apply --verbose manifests/site.pp</pre>
<p> command in a aws instance to follow the instruction from 'Deploying Rails', the following error complains that the puppet command is not found, like:</p>
<pre class="code">sudo: puppet: command not found</pre>
<p>After some searching and having a look at the blog post <a href="http://dan.carley.co/blog/2012/03/06/sudo-rbenv-me-a-sandwich/">here</a> and using the rvm notes in the aws instance and looking at this:
<pre class="code">  * On some systems (like Ubuntu) rvmsudo requires following changes to work properly:
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/257616/sudo-changes-path-why</pre>
<p>It seems that for security reason the sudo command resets the path in the system.</p>
<p>You can actually see that this the case by running the command to display the path of the normal user:</p>
<pre class="code">aws$ echo 'echo $PATH' | sh</pre>
<p>and the corresponding one for the sudo:</p>
<pre class="code">aws$ echo 'echo $PATH' | sudo sh</pre>
<p>So a workaround to make it work is to add your group into the exemptions group in the visudo file, which means editing the visudo file:</p>
<pre class="code">sudo visudo</pre>
<p>and adding the group that your user you are working with belongs to:</p>
<pre class="code">Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        exempt_group=name_of_your_group(or admin in some systems)</pre>
