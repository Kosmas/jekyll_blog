<p>Following the steps described in the "Deploying Rails Applications" book and using the currently latest puppet installation described <a href="http://www.42.mach7x.com/2012/12/11/vagrant-rvm-ruby-puppet-installation-instructions/" title="puppet installation" target="_blank">here</a>, the actual puppet files had to be modified slightly in order to make it work as expected.</p>
<p>The main issues requiring the changes were as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>System wide rvm installation - different paths, and the use of the rvmsudo command instead of sudo</li>
<li>Use of latest puppet gem (3.0.1) - ruby 1.9.3 is supported</li>
<li>Use of Debian/Ubuntu system - different way of configuring passenger with apache2</li>
</ul>
<p>So the full file for the passenger module (puppet/modules/passenger/manifests/init.pp) is:</p>
<pre class="code">
class passenger {

  # required for passenger gem
  package {
    "apache2-prefork-dev":
      ensure => installed
  }

  # required for passenger-apache-module
  package {
    "libcurl4-openssl-dev":
      ensure => installed
  }

  exec  {
    "gem install passenger -v=3.0.18":
      user    => vagrant,
      group   => vagrant,
      alias   => "install_passenger",
      require => Package["apache2"],
      unless  => "ls /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/bin/passenger",
      before  => Exec["passenger_apache_module"]
  }

  exec  {
    "passenger-install-apache2-module --auto":
      user    => root,
      group   => root,
      alias   => "passenger_apache_module",
      require => Package["apache2-prefork-dev","libcurl4-openssl-dev"],
      unless  => "ls /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/gems/passenger-3.0.18/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so",
      before  => File["passenger_conf"]
  }

  file  {
    "/etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.conf":
      mode    => 644,
      owner   => root,
      group   => root,
      alias   => "passenger_conf",
      source  => "/home/vagrant/puppet/modules/passenger/files/passenger.conf",
      before  => File["passenger_load"]
  }

  file {
    "/etc/apache2/mods-available/passenger.load":
      mode    => 644,
      owner   => root,
      group   => root,
      alias   => "passenger_load",
      notify  => Service["apache2"],
      source  => "/home/vagrant/puppet/modules/passenger/files/passenger.load",
      before  => Exec["enable_passenger"]
  }

  exec {
    "a2enmod passenger":
      user    => root,
      alias   => "enable_passenger"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Going through the file one of the first things to notice is the declaration about the "apache2-prefork-dev" package installation</p>
<pre class="code"> package {
    "apache2-prefork-dev":
      ensure => "installed"
  }</pre>
<p>The reason for this package, is that when trying to compile the passenger apache module (passenger-install-apache2-module), the script will complain that the following packages are missing:</p>
<pre class="code">apache2-prefork-dev
libapr1-dev
libaprutil1-dev</pre>
<p>By installing the first of the packages (apache2-prefork-dev) the other two are installed automatically as dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> In trying to install it in an Ubuntu AMI image in AWS EC2 there is also an additional package requirement because the installer complains about:</p>
<pre class="code">To install Curl development headers with SSL support:  Please run apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev or libcurl4-gnutls-dev, whichever you prefer.</pre>
<p>So there is the additional package added as:</p>
<pre class="code"># required for the passenger_apache_module
package {
  "libcurl4-openssl-dev":
    ensure  => installed
}</pre>
<p>Further down there are two file resources named "passenger_conf" and "passenger_load".<br />
Looking at the structure in debian for the apache2 configuration it seems that apache2 in debian needs two different files for each module that can be loaded one with named as module.conf and another as module.load to be placed into /etc/apache2/mods-available.</p>
<p>So we can create these two files and placed them in the files folder, as:</p>
<p>puppet/modules/passenger/files/passenger.conf</p>
<pre class="code"><ifmodule mod_passenger.c>
  PassengerRoot /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/gems/passenger-3.0.18
  PassengerRuby /usr/local/rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/ruby
  PassengerUseGlobalQueue on
  PassengerMaxPoolSize  5
  PassengerPoolIdleTime 900
  PassengerMaxRequests 10000
</ifmodule></pre>
<p>and, puppet/modules/passenger/files/passenger.load</p>
<pre class="code">LoadModule passenger_module /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327/gems/passenger-3.0.11/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so</pre>
<p>Which you can actually see if you compile manually the passenger apache2 module as they are described in the output on successful compilation:</p>
<pre class="code">The Apache 2 module was successfully installed.

Please edit your Apache configuration file, and add these lines:                                                                                                                                                                                

   LoadModule passenger_module /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/gems/passenger-3.0.18/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   PassengerRoot /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/gems/passenger-3.0.18
   PassengerRuby /usr/local/rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p327@rails3_2_9/ruby

After you restart Apache, you are ready to deploy any number of Ruby on Rails                                                                                                                                                                   
applications on Apache, without any further Ruby on Rails-specific                                                                                                                                                                              
configuration!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Press ENTER to continue.</pre>
<p>Finally the last section of the init.pp file enables the passenger module with the a2enmod apache command:</p>
<pre class="code">
  exec {
    "a2enmod passenger":
      user    => root,
      alias   => "enable_passenger"
  }</pre>
<p>A couple of useful apache2 commands when testing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To test what modules are availble for loading:
<pre class="code">a2enmod</pre>
<p>  If run after creating the two passenger files passenger.conf and passenger.load, then the passenger module should appear in the list</li>
<li>To see the currently enabled modules:
<pre class="code">apache2ctl -M</pre>
<p> Which again if it is run after the passenger modules has been enabled with a2enmod passenger then it should show an entry with
<pre class="code">passenger_module (shared)</pre>
</li>
</ul>
