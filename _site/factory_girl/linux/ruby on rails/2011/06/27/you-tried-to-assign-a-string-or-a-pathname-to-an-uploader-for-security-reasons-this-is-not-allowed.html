<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You would like to use Carrierwave for file uploads, but you get the following error if you are trying to use factories for running your cucumber scripts:</p>
<p><code>You tried to assign a String or a Pathname to an uploader, for security reasons, this is not allowed.</code></p>
<p>That happens if you try to assign inside your factory template, to your file field the path like f.file "path_to_file"</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>You would need to slightly modify your factory template to use the file path as follows:</p>
<p><code>f.file File.open(File.join(Rails.root,"path_to_file"))</code></p>
