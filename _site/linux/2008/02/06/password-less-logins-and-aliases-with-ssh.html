<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to be able to login to different servers with ssh, but don't want to be using your password every time.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
We assume that you already have installed ssh and have created ssh public keys in your local machine.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the following in your local machine:
<pre class="code">ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user_name@remote_host</pre>
</li>
<li>If you want to add aliases in your bash profile so you don't have to type the whole address of the remote host, edit your .bashrc and add:
<pre class="code">alias short_name="ssh user_name@remote_host"</pre>
</li>
<li>Restart your X server, or simply start a new terminal session</li>
<li>You should be able to login with ssh without using your password by typing in your command prompt in your local machine:
<pre class="code">short_name</pre>
</li>
</ol>
