<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You have two big tables in MySQL (>640K records), that maybe differ in the number of fields, but you want to make sure that the data in the common fields in both tables are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use mysql to export the data from the first table in a csv file, selecting only the common fields.<br />
We use the /tmp folder on the server to make sure we have the right permissions to create the file:</p>
<pre class="code">mysql>SELECT common_field1, common_field2, ... 
INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/first_table.txt'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
FROM table1;</pre>
</li>
<li><i>If the tables are in different databases remember to switch db:</i>
<pre class="code">use seconddb;</pre>
<p>Export the second table in the second file:</p>
<pre class="code">mysql>SELECT common_field1, common_field2, ... 
INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/second_table.txt'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
FROM table2;</pre>
</li>
<li>now use the diff. You can use any of the following options:
<ul>
<li>diff -q first_table.txt second_table.txt</li>
<li>diff first_table.txt second_table.txt > diff.txt</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
