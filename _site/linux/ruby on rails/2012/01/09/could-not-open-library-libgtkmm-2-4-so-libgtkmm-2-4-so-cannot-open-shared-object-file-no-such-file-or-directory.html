<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you have setup guard with your Rails project and you are trying to run it in an (K)Ubuntu installation you get the following message:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">Could not open library 'libgtkmm-2.4.so': libgtkmm-2.4.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Install the missing library with the following:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-2.4</pre>
