<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>In your rails project very often, after creating a new migration, you have to run the migration in the development database and then in the test database.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>A neat way to combine both these steps as one, taken from the book <a href="http://www.manning.com/bigg2/" title="Rails 4 in action" target="_blank">Rails 4 in Action</a>, is to create an alias in your ~/.bashrc configuration file with the following, so that you only have to run <em>migrate</em> after each migration that would apply the migration in both development and test databases:</p>
<pre class="shell">alias migrate='bin/rake db:migrate && bin/rake db:test:prepare'</pre>
