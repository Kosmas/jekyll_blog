<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
Trying to install ferret with sudo gem install ferret fails with the following error:<br />
<span class="code"><br />
fs_store.c:300: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments<br />
make: *** [fs_store.o] Error 1<br />
rake aborted!<br />
Command failed with status (2): [make...]</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
As the installation was not possible by using the gem install command, the next step was to download the ferret.tar.gz file extract it and try and install the plugin manually.<br />
It also failed with the same error message.<br />
After some googling for the error message it seems that newer gcc versions fail for non critical errors which in this case is caused by the make options <i>-Wformat -Werror=format-security</i><br />
So if you replace the:<br />
<span class="code">-Werror=format-security</span><br />
with<br />
<span class="code">-Wno-error</span></p>
<p>in the extracted folder/ext/Makefile</p>
<p>and then follow the original instructions as in:<br />
<span class="code"><br />
$ rake ext<br />
$ ruby setup.rb config<br />
$ ruby setup.rb setup<br />
# ruby setup.rb install</span></p>
<p>It should be installed correctly.</p>
