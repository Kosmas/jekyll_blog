<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You need to install OpenLDAP for testing the authentication against LDAP, but the command line utility ldapsearch is not installed in your system.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
You would need to install Mandriva's openldap-clients package that includes the ldapsearch:</p>
<p><code>sudo urpmi openldap-clients</code></p>
