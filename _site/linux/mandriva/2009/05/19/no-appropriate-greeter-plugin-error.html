<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
After upgrading to Mandriva 2009.1 Spring, that uses KDE 4, you can no longer lock the screen as you get the error:</p>
<pre class="code">no appropriate greeter plugin...</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
There is a package missing from the upgrade so do:</p>
<pre class="code">urpmi kdm</pre>
