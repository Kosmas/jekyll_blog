<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You have installed postfix in your local development machine (sudo apt-get install postfix), and you want to test sending emails from the command line using mail email_address@someone.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>You would first need to install the mailutils package:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">
sudo apt-get install mailutils
</pre>
<p>then you can send an email by:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">
mail email_name@example.com
CC: (leave blank)
Subject: Test subject
Main message body
</pre>
<p>and you can send it by pressing Ctrl+D</p>
