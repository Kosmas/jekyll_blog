<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to trigger a record insertion after a specific action has happened through javascript (ie drag - drop an item into a container), in a rails application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>You would need to get the object attributes from the html page somehow (ie user_id and user_name), and then have a function in your application js that calls the post function.</p>
<p>So if you have a drag and drop container for example then the code in the application.js should be like the following:</p>
<pre class="brush:js">$("#name_of_container").droppable({
  drop: handleDropEvent
});

function handleDropEvent(event,ui) {
  var user_id = ui.draggable.attr("user_id");
  var user_name = ui.draggable.attr("user_name");
  $.post('/users', {user: {user_id: user_id, name: user_name}})
}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
