<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to know what permission and for which repositories you have as a certain user when using gitolite to host your repositories.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that your gitolite user is gitolite and you have two different servers (server_a and server_b) with two different users (deploy_a and deploy_b) you can find out the permsissions by running the following:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">$server_a/deploy_a: ssh gitolite@git_host info

$server_b/deploy_b: ssh gitolite@git_host info</pre>
