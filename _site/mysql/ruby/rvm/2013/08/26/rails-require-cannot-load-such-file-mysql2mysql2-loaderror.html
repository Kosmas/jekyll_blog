<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You want to use a different ruby version from the one you have initially installed and build your application with, but when you change it in your rvm installation you get the following error:</p>
<pre class="shell">..gems/mysql2-0.3.13/lib/mysql2.rb:8:in `require': cannot load such 
file -- mysql2/mysql2 (LoadError)</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>To make it work again you will have to uninstall the mysql2 gem and install it again in the new ruby version with the option --platform=ruby.</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm use ruby-2.0.0-p247
cd my_project
rails s
..... gems/mysql2-0.3.13/lib/mysql2.rb:8:in `require': cannot load 
such file -- mysql2/mysql2 (LoadError)
gem uninstall mysql2
gem install mysql2 --platform=ruby
rails s
=> Booting WEBrick
....
</pre>
