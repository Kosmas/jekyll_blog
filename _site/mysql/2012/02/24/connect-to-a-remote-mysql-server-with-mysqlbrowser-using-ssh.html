<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to connect to a remote MySQL server using the Mysql-query-browser GUI tool, and you only have localhost access to the remote server, but also have ssh access to the remote server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>You can use the following command to start a port forwarding to your localhost and then use that to connect to the remote database server:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">ssh -L 3307:localhost:3306 user_name@remote_host -N</pre>
<p>You could then use the following to the Mysql-query-broser connection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">Hostname: 127.0.0.1
username: db_user_name_on_remote
password: db_user_password_on_remote
port: 3307</pre>
