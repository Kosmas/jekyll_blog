<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to upgrade your rails project from using rspec-rails 2.x to the latest rspec-rails 3.x version.  According to the rspec-rails documentation the new 3.x includes many breaking changes.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The full instructions for upgrading from rspec-rails 2.x to rspec-rails 3.x are <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs/upgrade">here</a>, but you may not need to complete all the steps described in there.<br />
So you could try with the following shorter steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run your rspec tests and make sure that they all pass</li>
<li>Upgrade your rspec-rails to the version 2.99 provided by the rspec-rails team</li>
<li>Run your rspec tests again, and you should have deprecation warnings. Usually that would consist of:
<pre class="shell">spec-rails 3 will no longer automatically infer an 
example group's spec type from the file location. 
You can explicitly opt-in to this feature using 
this snippet:

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
end</pre>
<p>which you could add to your spec/spec_helper.rb file</li>
<li>Run your rspec tests again and this time they should have no deprecation warnings</li>
<li>If they all pass then upgrade to the latest rspec-rails (ie 3.0.1).</li>
<li>Run your rspec tests again, and this time you should normally have one deprecation warning:
<pre class="shell">Requiring `rspec/autorun` when running RSpec via the `rspec` 
command is deprecated. 
Called from /xxx/xx/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:247:
in `require'.</pre>
</li>
<li>Delete the line require 'rspec/autorun' from your spec/spec_helper.rb file</li>
<li>Rerun your tests and they should all be passing in rspec-rails 3.x now</li>
</ul>
