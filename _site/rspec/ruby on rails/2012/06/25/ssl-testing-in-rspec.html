<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You have added the force_ssl option in your rails application, and the rspec tests fail with a redirection as ssl is required in the test evnironment.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Using a solution provided <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9728650/483283">here</a> you can add the following to your rspec test to ensure that ssl is used and the tests pass:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">before(:each) do
  request.env["rack.url_scheme"] = "https"
end
</pre>
