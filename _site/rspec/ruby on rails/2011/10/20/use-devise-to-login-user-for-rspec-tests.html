<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to test with RSpec for links that are visible only after the user signs into the application.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Use the following before method in your RSpec test:</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">before(:each) do
      @user = Factory(:user)
      sign_in @user
end</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
