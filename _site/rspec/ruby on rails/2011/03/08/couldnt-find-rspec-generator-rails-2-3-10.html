<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You are trying to use rspec with Ruby on Rails 2.3.10, but although you install the rspec and rspec-rails gems you get the following error when you try to run script/generate rspec<br />
<code>Couldn't find 'rspec' generator</code></p>
<p><srrong>Solution<br />
It turns out that there is a problem with the versions used, so by following the instructions for Rails >= 2.3.10 from <a href="https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/rails">here</a>, you should be able to install the plugins and use rspec:<br />
<code>ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec.git -r 'refs/tags/1.3.1'<br />
ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-rails.git -r 'refs/tags/1.3.3'<br />
ruby script/generate rspec</code></p>
<p>where the last tag (1.3.3) should be the latest tag for each gem.</p>
<p>*** NOTE *** If you get an error like :<br />
<code>You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!<br />
You might have expected an instance of Array.<br />
The error occurred while evaluating nil.map (NoMethodError) </code></p>
<p>uncomment the following line (line 11) from features/support/env.rb:<br />
<code>require 'cucumber/rails/rspec'</code><br />
and run rake cucumber again.</srrong></p>
