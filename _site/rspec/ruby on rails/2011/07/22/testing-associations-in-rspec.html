<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You would like to test your model associations in an RSpec model spec, to make sure that they are correctly set up.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
After some Google searching and coming across this article <a href="http://liahhansen.com/2011/04/14/testing-model-associations-in-rspec.html">here</a>, ended up using the second method described there with the reflect_on_association method, as it doesn't need the inclusion of another gem.<br />
So for example to to test multiple has_many or belongs_to associations in your model rspec you could use something like:<br />
<code>context "check associations" do<br />
    # belongs_to associations<br />
    %w{bel_to1 bel_to2}.each do |bt|<br />
      it "should belong to #{bt}" do<br />
        m = Model.reflect_on_association(:"#{bt}")<br />
        m.macro.should == :belongs_to<br />
      end<br />
    end<br />
    # has_many associations<br />
    %w{has_many1 has_many2 has_many3}.each do |hm|<br />
      it "should have many #{hm}" do<br />
        m = Model.reflect_on_association(:"#{hm}")<br />
        m.macro.should == :has_many<br />
      end<br />
    end<br />
  end</code></p>
