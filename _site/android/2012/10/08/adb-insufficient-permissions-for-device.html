<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You are trying to use the Android Debug Bridge (adb), but running it from the command line trying to list the connected devices you get the error:</p>
<pre class="shell">insufficient permissions for device</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>You would need to start the adb server with su permissions, so you can try the following:</p>
<pre class="shell">adb kill-server
sudo adb start-server
adb devices
adb logcat</pre>
