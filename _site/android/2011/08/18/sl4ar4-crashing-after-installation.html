<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
After installing SL4A_r4 (Scripting Layer for Android), on your Android phone, and before installing any interpreters every time you start your SL4A app, it keeps crashing after a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
If you install an interpreter (ie JRuby), then the application stops crashing.<br />
You would need to be quick to start the installation before the application crashes, by doing the following:</p>
<p>Settings -> View -> Interpreters -> Settings -> Add and then select the interpreter you would like.</p>
