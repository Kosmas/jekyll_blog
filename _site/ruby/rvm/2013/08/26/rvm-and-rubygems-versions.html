<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to upgrade your rubygems version from 1.8.17 to the latest version 2.0.7 for example.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>You can upgrade to a specific or the latest gem version and relate that to a specific rvm ruby that you have installed.<br />
So if for example you have ruby-1.9.3-p327 and ruby-2.0.0-p247, you can have different gem version (or the same if you want) for each ruby version.</p>
<p>To upgrade to the latest one in the ruby-2.0.0-p247 for example you could do the following:</p>
<pre class="shell">
rvm list
rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p327
gem -version
1.8.17
rvm use ruby-2.0.0-p247
gem --version
1.8.17
gem update --system
gem --version
2.0.7
rvm use ruby-1.9.3-p327
gem --version
1.8.17
</pre>
