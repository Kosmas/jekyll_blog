<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You are trying to install the new ruby in your ubuntu rvm installation with rvm install 2.1 but you are getting the error:</p>
<pre class="shell">Branch origin/ruby_2_1_0 not found.
There has been an error while checking out branch ruby_2_1_0.
Halting the installation.                               
There has been an error fetching the ruby interpreter. 
Halting the installation.</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>If you are careful and you notice a warning message as:</p>
<pre class="shell">Warning, new version of rvm available '1.25.26', 
you are using older version '1.24.8'.</pre>
<p>then you would need to update your rvm installation to the latest one with:</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm update</pre>
<p>And then you should be able to install the latest ruby version with:</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm install 2.1</pre>
