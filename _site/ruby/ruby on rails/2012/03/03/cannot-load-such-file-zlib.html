<p><strong>Problemo<br />
</strong></p>
<p>You are trying to install a gem with rvm but you are getting the following error:</p>
<p>ERROR: Loading command: install (LoadError<br />
cannot load such file -- zlib<br />
ERROR: While executing gem ... (NameError)<br />
uninitialized constant Gem::Commands::InstallCommand</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Following from the post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/769496/ubuntu-noob-rails-install-fails-on-zlib&quot;">here</a></p>
<p>you would need to install the zlib library with rvm, uninstall your ruby version and then install the ruby version again with the folowing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:applescript">rvm pkg install zlib

rvm uninstall 1.9.3

rvm install 1.9.3</pre>
