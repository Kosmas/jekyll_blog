<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to remap your Caps Lock key to Ctrl so it is easier to use as the 'Prefix' in tmux.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Go to System Settings -> Input Devices -> Keyboard -> Advanced<br />
and tick first the 'Configure keyboard options' and then<br />
in the 'Ctrl key position' select 'Caps Lock as Ctrl'</p>
