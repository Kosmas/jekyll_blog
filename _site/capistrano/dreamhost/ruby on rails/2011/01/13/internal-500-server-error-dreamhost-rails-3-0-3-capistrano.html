<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to deploy your Rails 3.0.3 in Dreamhost with capistrano, but even though you follow the steps from a previous post <a href="http://www.42.mach7x.com/2011/01/13/rails-3-bundler-dreamhost-capistrano/">here</a>, when you go to the application's main page you still get an error: </p>
<p><code>500 Internal Server Error</code></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Thanks to a blog post from Brendon Wilson <a href="http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2011/01/07/rails-3-on-dreamhost-via-capistrano/">here</a>, the last missing piece from the puzzle in order to have your application running is to add the following line to the top of your deploy.rb file:</p>
<p><code>require 'bundler/capistrano'</code></p>
<p>and redo your cap deploy.</p>
<p>Thanks Brendon.</p>
