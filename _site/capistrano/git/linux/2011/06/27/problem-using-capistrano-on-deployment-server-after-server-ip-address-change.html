<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
After changing the IP address of your staging server the cap deploy does not work any more and gives you the following error:</p>
<p><code>** [192.168.0.50 :: err] Host key verification failed.<br />
 ** [192.168.0.50 :: err] fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly</code></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
You would need to login to your staging server (as your deployment user) and do an initial checkout for one time for the ssh keys to work.<br />
So you could do something like the following:</p>
<p><code>$ ssh user_name@staging_server<br />
$sh -c 'git clone -q git_user@192.168.0.50:repo_name /some/tmp/dir/temp_repo_name</code></p>
<p>Make sure that you reply 'y' to the question about the authenticity of the host as in:<br />
<code>The authenticity of host '192.168.0.50 (192.168.0.50)' can't be established.<br />
RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xxb.<br />
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes<br />
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.50' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.</code></p>
<p>Next delete the newly created git project from your tmp directory, and then you should be able to use cap deploy as normal again from your development pc</p>
