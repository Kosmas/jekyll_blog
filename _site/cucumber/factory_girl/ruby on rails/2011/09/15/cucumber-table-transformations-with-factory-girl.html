<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
After reading this post <a title="Cucumber Table transformations" href="http://www.claytonlz.com/index.php/2010/01/cucumber-table-transformations/">here</a>, to be able to use the Cucumber table trasformatios feature to build objects in your cucumber tests, you would like to use FactoryGirl instead of the standard model.<br />
The reason for using FactoryGirl could be that your model needs a few more attributes (mandatory fields), that you don't want to specify in your cucumber table, but you want the factory to take care of them.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
The only difference would take place in the transformation step.<br />
So if you would originally have the following:</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">Transform /^table:Vehicle,User,Start,End$/ do |table|
  table.hashes.map do |hash|
    vehicle = Vehicle.create!({:regno =&gt; hash['Vehicle']})
    user = User.create!({:first_name =&gt; hash['User']})
    booking = Booking.create!({:start_at =&gt; hash['Start'],
                               :end_at =&gt; hash['End']})
    {:vehicle =&gt; vehicle, :user =&gt; user, :booking =&gt; booking}
  end
end</pre>
<p>and for example your user has also fields like password, date of birth, that are mandatory in the model validations, you would put them in your factory define declaration like:</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">Factory.define(:user) do |u|
u.first_name "Name"
u.last_name "Lastname"
u.address1 "Address1"
u.address2 "Line 2"
u.address3 "Line 3"
u.zip "1111"
u.city "City"
u.sequence(:email) {|n|"teste#{n}@test.com"}
u.profile_picture File.open(File.join(Rails.root,"features/fixtures/user.png"))
u.password "password"
end</pre>
<p>and replace the tranformation to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">Transform /^table:Vehicle,User,Start,End$/ do |table|
table.hashes.map do |hash|
vehicle = Factory(:vehicle, :regno =&gt; hash['Vehicle'])
user = Factory(:user,:first_name =&gt; hash['User'])
booking = Factory(:booking, :start_at =&gt; hash['Start'],
:end_at =&gt; hash['End'])

{:vehicle =&gt; vehicle, :user =&gt; user, :booking =&gt; booking}
end
end</pre>
<p>The actual step would similar to the one in the blog article:</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">Given /^the following bookings?:$/ do |table|
# table is a Cucumber::Ast::Table
table.each do |group|
booking = group[:booking]
associations = {:vehicle =&gt; group[:vehicle], :user =&gt; group[:user]}
booking.update_attributes(associations)
end
end</pre>
