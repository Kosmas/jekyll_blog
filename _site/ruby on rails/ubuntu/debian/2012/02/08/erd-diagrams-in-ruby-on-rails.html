<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to have an ERD diagram of your database in your Ruby on Rails project.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>You can install the Rails ERD from <a title="rails erd" href="http://rails-erd.rubyforge.org/">here</a>, and install it by following the instructions.<br />
For Ubuntu/debian systems should be:</p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo apt-get install graphviz</pre>
<p>and then adding the gem to your Gemfile in the development section as:</p>
<pre class="brush:ruby">group :development do
  gem "rails-erd", "~&gt; 0.4.5"
end</pre>
<p>You can then run bundle install to install the gem and rake erb to create the diagram pdf.</p>
