<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to use ActiveScaffold in Rails 2.2, in a model that you have created using the standard Rails scaffolding script.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Install the ActiveScaffold plugin:
<pre class="code">script/plugin install git://github.com/activescaffold/active_scaffold.git -r rails-2.2</pre>
</li>
<li>In your layout (model or application for all models) add the following:
<pre class="code"><%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
<%= active_scaffold_includes %></pre>
</li>
<li>In your controller file delete all the standard scaffolding code and add one line, so that your new controller should look like:
<pre class="code">class SomethingsController < ApplicationController
  active_scaffold :something
end</pre>
</li>
<li>To configure a RESTful scaffold add the following to your route.rb file:
<pre class="code">map.resources :somethings, :active_scaffold => true</pre>
</li>
<li>Delete the views that were created from the standard rails scaffolding in the views/somethings folder (edit, show, index ...)</li>
<li>Restart your server</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have an active scaffold for your model.</p>
