<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>After using brakeman to test for security issues in your rails application you get the following warning about the config/initializers/secret_token.rb file:</p>
<pre class="shell">Session secret should not be included in version control near line xx</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Since you may have already pushed the original secret_token.rb in your version control you may need to do the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a copy of the file : cp config/initializers/secret_token.rb config/initializers/copy_of_secret_token.rb</li>
<li>Delete the original file that is also on your version control: rm config/initializers/secret_token.rb</li>
<li>Add it to .gitgnore</li>
<li>Commit your changes and push to your version control: git commit -a -m "remove secret token and include it in .gitignore", git push (origin master)</li>
<li>Create a new secret key by running: rake secret</li>
<li>Copy the value from above to the file config/initializers/copy_of_secret_token.rb replacing the original value of config.secret_key_base </li>
<li>Rename the file to secret_token.rb again: mv config/initializers/copy_of_secret_token.rb config/initializers/secret_token.rb</li>
<li>Check that the new file is not listed in git when you do : git status</li>
</ul>
