<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
Trying to use ExtJS with RubyOnRails on Heroku, gives the following error and a blank page in Firebug.</p>
<pre class="code">Ext.ux.grid has no properties
...
Line 141</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
In Heroku, you will probably have to manually upload the files from the ExtJS library, as well as the ext_scaffold plugin.<br />
When you do that, two files that ext_scaffold needs, and which they should be located in ext_scaffold/assets/javascripts should be copied to public/javascripts.<br />
The files are:</p>
<pre class="code">ext_datetime.js
ext_searchfield.js</pre>
