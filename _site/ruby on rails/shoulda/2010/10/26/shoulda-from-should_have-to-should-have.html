<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
Your old tests with shoulda are written using the old style should_have, should_belong, etc, which are now deprecated.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
The new style of writing shoulda unit tests is should have, should belong_to etc. All the new macros can be found <a href="http://rdoc.info/github/thoughtbot/shoulda/master/Shoulda/ActiveRecord/Matchers">here</a></p>
