<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
When trying to use cucumber in a new rails 3.0.7 application you get the following error when running rake cucumber for the first time:<br />
<code>uninitialized constant Capybara (NameError)</code></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
As cucumber is moving to using capybara instead of webrat as default, if you follow the instructions in the Rspec book for setting up you would get the above error.<br />
What you would need to do is to replace webrat with capybara.<br />
You can do that by commenting out /removing webrat from your Gemfile and then adding the following:<br />
<code><br />
gem 'capybara'<br />
gem 'database_cleaner'<br />
</code></p>
