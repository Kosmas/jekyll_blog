<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
When upgrading the gmaps4rails gem to version 0.10.0 the markers are not displayed any more on the map.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
There is an issue raised about the bug <a href="https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails/issues/58" title="here">here</a>.<br />
To make the markers appear downgrade to version 0.9.1 of the gem.</p>
<p><strong>update:</strong> or upgrade to 0.10.2 as the bug is fixed.</p>
