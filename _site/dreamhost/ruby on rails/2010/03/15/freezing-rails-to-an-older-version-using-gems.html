<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You want to deploy to a shared host (dreamhost) that has a later version of rails from the one you have developed your application.<br />
You also have a later version installed in your development pc,and using rake rails:freeze:gems uses the latest one and not the one you want.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Use the following to freeze the specific version you want, and by using your gems you have installed:<br />
<span class="code">rake rails:freeze:gems VERSION=2.3.2</span></p>
