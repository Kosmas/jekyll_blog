<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You get a '406 Not Acceptable'  response from the web server when you try to use the princely plugin for generating pdf on a Ruby on Rails application hosted on dreamhost.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Having tried the 'Extra Web Security' settings in dreamhost Web panel, and setting them on/off did not get very far.<br />
Also setting up an .htaccess file didn't seem to make any difference.<br />
So the mod_security settings did not seem to be the cause of the problem.<br />
Having a look at the apache error log files which in the case of the dreamhost ps are in /usr/local/dh/apache2/logs/apache2-ps_name it turns out that the problem was that the path for the prince binary was not setting up correctly in the file vendor/plugins/princely/lib/prince.rb on line 26.<br />
A quick hack to make it work until finding the reason for the problem is to hardcode the path to the prince binary, so:<br />
<span class="code">@exe_path = `which prince`.chomp<br />
if @exe_path.nil?<br />
  @exe_path='/usr/local/bin/prince'<br />
end</span></p>
