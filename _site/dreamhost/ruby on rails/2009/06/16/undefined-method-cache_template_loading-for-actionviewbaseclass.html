<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
While developing on Rails 2.3.2 you want to deploy in dreamhost that uses 2.2.2 at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
Although we could try to freeze the specific rails version we are using, it's probably easier as a temporary solution, until dreamhost upgrades the rails version to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that we have the following line with the appropriate version of </li>
<pre class="code">RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.2.2' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION</pre>
<p>   in the config/environment.rb file</p>
<li>Rename the application_controller.rb file back to application.rb</li>
<li>Comment out the following line from config/environments/production.rb</li>
<pre class="code">config.action_view.cache_template_loading = true</pre>
</ul>
