<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>After installing rvm on dreamhost, when trying to install any ruby version afterwards, there is a prompt for password, and when entering the user's password there is the message that the user is not in the sudoers list.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>To be able to install the rvm ruby version you would like you should be installing them by using the following which is based on the answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15798461/how-do-i-use-rvm-to-install-ruby-on-a-dreamhost-shared-server">here </a>:</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm list remote
ruby-1.9.3-p194
   ruby-1.9.3-p286
   ruby-1.9.3-p327
   ruby-1.9.3-p362
   ruby-1.9.3-p374
   ruby-1.9.3-p392
   ruby-1.9.3-p429

   ruby-2.0.0-p0

<p>and then:</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm mount -r https://rvm.io/binaries/debian/6/x86_64/ruby-2.0.0-p247.tar.bz2 --verify-downloads 1</pre>
