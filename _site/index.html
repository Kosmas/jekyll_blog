  <a href="/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">Upgrading jquery-ui-rails from 4.2.1 to 0.5.0</a>
</h2>
<span>August 12, 2014</span>
<p>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to upgrade your jquery-ui-rails gem from a version before 0.5.x to the latest version 0.5.0, but when you do that your tests are failing with error messages similar to the one below:</p>
<pre class="shell">ActionView::Template::Error: 
couldn't find file 'jquery.ui.effect-blind'</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>According to the changelog the naming between 4.2.1 and 0.5.0 has changed <a href="https://github.com/joliss/jquery-ui-rails">jquery-ui-rails</a></p>
<p>So if you were using something like the following in your app/assets/javascripts/applications.js file (as used in the depot example in the Agile Web Development with Rails 4 book):</p>
<pre class="shell">//= require jquery.ui.effect-blind</pre>
<p>you would need to change it to the following after upgrading your jquery-ui-rails gem to ~> 0.5.0:</p>
<pre class="shell">//= require jquery-ui/effect-blind</pre>

  <a href="/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">Upgrading from rspec-rails 2.x to rspec-rails 3.x</a>
</h2>
<span>July  5, 2014</span>
<p>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You would like to upgrade your rails project from using rspec-rails 2.x to the latest rspec-rails 3.x version.  According to the rspec-rails documentation the new 3.x includes many breaking changes.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The full instructions for upgrading from rspec-rails 2.x to rspec-rails 3.x are <a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs/upgrade">here</a>, but you may not need to complete all the steps described in there.<br />
So you could try with the following shorter steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run your rspec tests and make sure that they all pass</li>
<li>Upgrade your rspec-rails to the version 2.99 provided by the rspec-rails team</li>
<li>Run your rspec tests again, and you should have deprecation warnings. Usually that would consist of:
<pre class="shell">spec-rails 3 will no longer automatically infer an 
example group's spec type from the file location. 
You can explicitly opt-in to this feature using 
this snippet:

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
end</pre>
<p>which you could add to your spec/spec_helper.rb file</li>
<li>Run your rspec tests again and this time they should have no deprecation warnings</li>
<li>If they all pass then upgrade to the latest rspec-rails (ie 3.0.1).</li>
<li>Run your rspec tests again, and this time you should normally have one deprecation warning:
<pre class="shell">Requiring `rspec/autorun` when running RSpec via the `rspec` 
command is deprecated. 
Called from /xxx/xx/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:247:
in `require'.</pre>
</li>
<li>Delete the line require 'rspec/autorun' from your spec/spec_helper.rb file</li>
<li>Rerun your tests and they should all be passing in rspec-rails 3.x now</li>
</ul>

  <a href="/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">bin/rails:6: warning: already initialized constant APP_PATH</a>
</h2>
<span>July  1, 2014</span>
<p>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You are getting the error:</p>
<pre class="shell">bin/rails:6: warning: already initialized constant APP_PATH</pre>
<p>when you are trying to start the local webserver with rails s.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>That happens when are using the bootstrap rails gem as in:</p>
<pre class="shell">gem 'anjlab-bootstrap-rails', require: 'bootstrap_rails'</pre>
<p>It is important that the bootstap rails uses in the require is used with a dash and <strong>NOT an underscore</strong>.<br />
So when you write the the gem as follows:</p>
<pre class="shell">gem 'anjlab-bootstrap-rails', require: 'bootstrap-rails'</pre>
<p>and restart your server you should no longer have the error message.</p>

  <a href="/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent link to ">rvm - Branch origin/ruby_2_1_0 not found.</a>
</h2>
<span>May 27, 2014</span>
<p>
  <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>You are trying to install the new ruby in your ubuntu rvm installation with rvm install 2.1 but you are getting the error:</p>
<pre class="shell">Branch origin/ruby_2_1_0 not found.
There has been an error while checking out branch ruby_2_1_0.
Halting the installation.                               
There has been an error fetching the ruby interpreter. 
Halting the installation.</pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>If you are careful and you notice a warning message as:</p>
<pre class="shell">Warning, new version of rvm available '1.25.26', 
you are using older version '1.24.8'.</pre>
<p>then you would need to update your rvm installation to the latest one with:</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm update</pre>
<p>And then you should be able to install the latest ruby version with:</p>
<pre class="shell">rvm install 2.1</pre>
