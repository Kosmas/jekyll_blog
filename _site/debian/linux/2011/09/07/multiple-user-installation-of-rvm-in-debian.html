<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
You would like to install rvm as a multiple user installation in Debian.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
You would need to do the following:</p>
<p><strong>as root</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>for each individual user you want to use rvm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>in the user's .bashrc or .bashrc_profile add the following at the bottom:<br />
<code>[[ -s "/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.</code></li>
<li>reload the .bashrc or .bashrc_profile by:<br />
<code>source .bashrc|.bashrc_profile</code></li>
</ul>
<p>and you should be able to do rvm -v.</p>
